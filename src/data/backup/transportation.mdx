# Harvesting and Transportation

<h1 class="parafont">Harvesting of Shoots and Leaves</h1>

The moringa tree has a compound leaf: one leaf is made up of multiple leaflets. What is referred to here as a leaf is precisely multiple leaflets attached to the rachis which stems from the branch.

Manual harvesting of shoots and leaves with a pair of shears, a sickle or a sharp knife is recommended. All shoots should be cut at the desired height, i.e. 30 cm to 1 meter above ground. Mechanical harvesters could also be used for large-scale, intensive leaf production.

Harvesting can also be done by removing the leaves, picking them directly off the tree. They are easily removed at the base of the petiole. It is quicker to harvest this way but the trees will not have benefited from a good pruning and the following growth is therefore less vigorous.

A high level of hygiene should be maintained. Produce should be harvested at the coolest time of the day: early morning or late in the evening. It is important to make sure there is no dew on the produce before harvesting, especially in the morning, to avoid rot during transport.

<h1 class="parafont aline">Harvesting of Seeds</h1>

In seed farms, pods should be harvested as early as possible when they reach maturity, i.e. when they turn brown and dry. Fruits should open easily. Seeds are extracted, bagged, and stored in a dry place. Moringa branches break easily; it is not recommended to climb up the tree to harvest the fruits.

<h1 class="parafont aline">Transportation</h1>

<p><span class="parabold">Transportation in moringa leaf production is a very critical step in ensuring high quality leaves for consumption.</span></p>

<p><span class="parabold">Two options:</span>
<ul>
<li>Cut big branches and transport whole to the processing centre if nearby, before defoliating 
(stripping or removing the leaves from the branch).</li>

<li> Strip the leaves off the branches before transporting them to the processing centre. 
Leaves can be tied together in bunches by their stem or better, thinly spread out on trays or 
mesh to reduce temperature build up.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Freshly harvested material should be transported to the processing centre as quickly as 
possible to avoid deterioration. Fresh moringa leaves, transported loosely, should be well 
ventilated. For shorter distances aerated baskets or perforated plastic containers should be 
used to transport the fresh leaves. Avoid open vehicles. </p>

<p><span class="parabold">Under no circumstances should people or goods be placed on top of leaves. </span></p>
<p>Transportation should be during the cooler parts of theday: early morning, evening or night.
Leaves being transported over long distances should be in air-conditioned or refrigerated
vans to keep them cool until delivery at the processing centre.</p>
