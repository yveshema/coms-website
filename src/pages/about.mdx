# Nutritional Value and <br/>Benefits of Moringa

The moringa plant (Moringa oleifera) is known worldwide for its nutritional and medicinal 
benefits and industrial uses. It produces harvestable leaves within just six months and can 
thrive even on degraded land. Almost every part of the moringa plant has nutritional value. 
The pod can be cooked as a vegetable.

The root can be used as a substitute for horseradish. The flower is eaten as greens, boiled, 
fried, in soups or for seasoning. Dried leaf powder can be added to any kind of meal as a 
nutritional supplement. The seed can be roasted and eaten like a peanut. The seeds can be 
used as a flocculent to clarify water and as a source of a non-drying and very stable oil, 
known as Ben oil. This oil, which was once used for lubricating watches and other delicate 
machinery, is clear, sweet, and odourless, almost never going rancid. It is edible and it is 
becoming increasingly popular in the cosmetic industry. 

Leaves and young branches are used as fodder. Moringa may also be used in fish and 
poultry feeds. The bark yields a blue dye and can also be used in tanning. The wood can produce paper. A plant growth hormone can be extracted from young shoots, which when applied as a foliar spray, increases yields dramatically in almost any plant. Last but not least, almost every part of the plant has pharmacological properties.

# Moringa Comparison With <br/>Other Types of Foods

Moringa contains an extraordinary array of micronutrients, vitamins and minerals needed 
for a balanced, healthy diet. Moringa leaves are 30% high-quality protein and are among a handful of vegetables that contain all 9 essential amino acids (18 in all).  Added to staple foods like bread and flour, moringa could help hundreds of millions of malnourished 
people. Moringa has been used as a weaning food for infants and increases lactation in nursing mothers. 
<p style="font-weight:500;">Dried moringa leaf powder has registered the highest ORAC (Oxygen Radical 
Absorbance Capacity) score ever recorded, topping all other antioxidant superfoods 
such as Acai berries, green tea, and red wine.</p>

# Why Cultivating Moringa and Meeting Quality Standards are important?

This leafy vegetable is an exceptional resource for developing countries. Processed or fresh, the moringa leaf is not only a new, promising source of income and employment but also an outstanding, nutritionally rich vegetable for families and businesses. However, Leaf powder, if of poor sanitary quality, can cause digestive illnesses. Counterfeit products (various mixtures of dried leaves, even ground twigs) are also an issue in certain countries.

Packaging also has an impact on quality: moringa leaf powder, packaged in transparent bags, sold on stands in the sun, rapidly loses its most essential vitamins. This raises concerns, and rightly so, about the quality of this new product as well as its uses.
