# Who We Are

The Caribbean Organic Moringa Standard (COMS) is an element of the agricultural 
innovation, carbon mitigation, and export quality adjunct of the 0001 Caribbean 
Regional Initiative. 

As part of a sub-programmatic focus on native and adapted plants, modelled sustainable 
outcomes include increased entrepreneurship, improved national health, biophilia 
awareness, and increased FDI. Also, potential indirect outcomes include greening, 
hardscape/heat island reduction in urban areas, and improved drainage. This concept 
could not have been possible without the moringa research and publications of 
Mr. Mozart Adevu, Dr Armelle de Saint Sauveur, Mr. Godfred Dosu, and Dr Mélanie Broin, who 
authored the Ghanaian standard, the foundation for this work. 

We would like to acknowledge the support of evolveˣ, Agency Carbon/Green, and SustainT&T, 
with financial assistance from The Resilience Fund and the BAF. The COMS project has been 
created to drive technical engagement from the Centre for the Development of 
Enterprise (CDE), CROSQ and CARDI, as well as financial support from the IADB.
