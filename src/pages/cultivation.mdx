# Intro

The information in this section will depict in detail how to cultivate,  transport and process moringa according to the Ghana organic moringa standard. The purpose of this documentation is to provide an easy-to-follow set of practices to ensure that moringa products comply with all safety and environmental requirements. The practices recommended here will help to promote good farming and manufacturing methods to obtain healthy trees and quality-processed products.

To ensure top results and benefits, the following four steps are fundamental  in moringa cultivation:

>* Site selection
>* Land preparation
>* Planting/sowing
>* Maintenance of the plantation

The ease with which the roots spread is a necessary condition in plant  growth and development. <span style="font-weight:500;">Moringa therefore requires a well-drained  loamy or sandy soil for optimal growth</span>. from the field. If planting density is high, the land must be ploughed and harrowed to a maximum depth of 30 cm. 

If planting density is low (>1 m x 1 m),  it is better to dig pits and refill them with the soil. This ensures good root system penetration without causing too much land erosion (ploughing can be risky in some tropical environments, in the cases  of heavy rains, wind or sloping). In this case, the pits must be 30 to-50  cm deep, and 20 to 40 cm wide. When refilling the pit, mix the soil with manure. For the farmer producing moringa on a large scale, it is recommended that soil and seed testing are done to ensure good returns on investment.


<Title anchorId="propagation" icon={propagationIcon} heading="Propagation" />


#### Moringa can be propagated from seeds or from mature cuttings (brown wood).

<h2 className="hdesign"> Seed Propagation</h2>
<p>Purchase or collect your supply of seeds from reliable sources. A good seed should be viable, clean and disease free.  <span style="font-weight:500;">Seeds should not be stored over long periods as they lose viability (germination capacity) after about one year</span>.</p>

<p>There are around 4000 moringa seeds (with their shell) in a kilo.  Seeds may be sown in containers, in seedbeds or directly in the field. Direct seeding is preferable when the germination rate is high, which is the case with Moringa oleifera. In Togo for instance, in small holders’ farms, the germination rate is more than 85% only 12 days after seeding.</p>

**Production in seedbeds has the following drawbacks:**
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It requires more work, especially when transplanting</li>
<li>Transplanting can damage the taproot: fragile and essential in ensuring the future yield    and the drought resistance of the plant</li>
</ul></blockquote>

**Production in containers has the following drawbacks:**
<blockquote>
<ul>
 <li>It is very time consuming: filling and placing the bags, maintenance, transport   
   and transplanting</li>
<li>It is expensive in manpower and material</li>
</ul></blockquote>

## Direct Seeding 

<p><span className="parabold">Seeds must be sown at a maximum depth of 2 cm</span>. Deeper seeding will greatly reduce the germination rate. One or two seeds per pit can be sown. When seeds are expensive or difficult to acquire, a better option is to plant one seed only and to wait two weeks for 
germination to occur. Then, the empty spaces are refilled. When the seed quality is more 
uncertain or the seeding period not optimal, use two seeds per pit. 

If the two seeds germinate, the weaker plant can be removed after they reach about 30 cm. This must be done carefully to avoid damaging the root system of the remaining plant. <span className="parabold">Transplanting seedlings produced by direct seeding is not advised, as there is a high risk of damaging the taproot. </span>

<span className="parabold">Moringa seeds germinate 5 to 12 days after seeding. If the seed has not germinated after two weeks, it will not and must be replaced.</span> If neither of the two seeds germinate, the pit must be opened to check if there is a localized insect attack (ants or termites). 
If this is the case, the pit must be treated with a Neem leaf solution or, better yet, with Neem oil mixed with soapy water. Then seeding can be done again.</p>

## Propagation in Containers

<p>Suitable containers are polyethylene bags or sacks prefilled with damp loamy soil popularly known as “Top soil”. Sowing depth should be no more than 2 cm. Seeds should germinate within 5-12 days after sowing. Place the bag(s) in a slightly shaded area and where they are protected from heavy rains. If this is not possible, make a set of small incisions (2-3) on 
the polybag to serve as drains to avoid water logging. Water the seed every 2 to 3 days depending on the dampness of the soil, 10-20 ml of water applied to each bag is recommended.<span className="parabold"> At this stage the young shoot or plant must be well protected from grasshoppers, locusts, termites and ruminants.</span></p>

<p>Watering must be done with extreme care to avoid collapse of the feeble plant due to pressure. Collapsed plants must be suitably supported. <span className="parabold">The young moringa plants must be nursed for 4-6 weeks before transplanting.</span> when they are about 30 cm high. Remove the polythene bag when transplanting ensuring that the roots of the plant arenot damaged.</p>

## Propagation by Cuttings

Hard woodcuttings of one meter long and at least 4 to 5 cm in  diameter can also be used for propagation. When planted, one third of the stem must be buried in the soil. Plants produced with cuttings will not have a deep root system and will be more sensitive to wind and drought. Cuttings are also more sensitive to termite attacks.

#### For leaf production, several methods can be considered.


## Intensive Production

The spacing of plants should be 15 x 15 cm or 20 x 10 cm, with conveniently spaced alleys (for example: every 4 meters) to facilitate plantation management and harvests.

Another option is to space the seeding lines 45 cm apart and to sow every 5 cm on those lines. One can also space the lines only 30 cm apart and sow at a larger distance on the lines (10 to 20 cm). These intensive systems are appropriate for commercial production but require careful management. Weeding, manuring and disease prevention require more skill because of the high density.

<figure>
    <img src={intensiveProduction} alt="intensive production" />
</figure>

## Semi-intensive Production

Plants are spaced 50 cm to 1 m apart. This is more appropriate for  small-scale farmers and gives good results with less maintenance.

<figure>
    <img src={semiIntensiveProduction} alt="semi intensive production" />
</figure>

## Agroforestry

Moringa trees can be sown in alleys and associated with other crops.   The distance between moringa rows must be 2 to 4 meters, and they must be oriented East-West to ensure that intercrops receive enough sun.

**It is advisable to avoid associating moringa with:**
>* Crops that require a lot of nitrogen, such as maize or cassava;
>* Crops that require chemical treatments;
>* Crops that can compete for light with moringa trees millet, sorghum). It is better to 
associate crops that can enrich the soil in minerals, especially in nitrogen like leguminous plants such as groundnut, soy or beans.

    <img src={agroforestry} alt="agroforestry" />
</figure>

## Seed Production

Spacing must be much wider for fruit or seed production. Trees must be at least 2.5 m apart. Line and peg using a 3 x 3 meter triangular pattern for seed-producing farms. This will optimize plant population density.


<Title anchorId="care" icon={plantCareIcon} heading="Plant Care" />

#### Moringa requires a lot of care and maintenance to produce the expected yields.


## Shaping the Trees

As Moringa oleifera tends to produce long branches that grow vertically and produce leaves and fruits only at their extremity, yields will be low if the trees are left to grow naturally. The tree can grow to heights of about 3 to 4 meters in the first year and continue to about 10-12 m thereafter. It is therefore essential to give the trees a good shape when they are young, by enhancing lateral branching thus creating bushy growth.

Pinching the terminal bud on the central stem is necessary when the tree attains a height of 50 cm to 1 m. This will trigger the growth of lateral branches which must be pinched too. This will promote the growth of many lateral branches, increase yields and reduce the height of the tree. In addition, pinching reduces damage due to heavy winds and makes harvesting much easier.

Pinching can be done with the finger nails as the stems are tender. If the trees are older and pinching was not carried out early enough, the terminal stem can be cut with a sharp tool, just above a node. Cutting in the internodes will cause the rotting of the stem all the way down to the node below the cut, and will give way to diseases and parasites.

## Irrigation

Moringa can germinate and grow without irrigation if it is sown during the rainy season. 
Its tuberous root develops in twenty days and allows young plants to endure drought. However, for optimal growth, it is advisable to irrigate regularly during the first 3 months after seeding. Irrigation is also necessary to produce leaves all year long, including during dry seasons.

Another option is to stop producing during these periods: the trees will shed their leaves but will not die. At the onset of the rains, a good pruning and adding some organic manure will ensure that the trees start producing many new branches and leaves.

Any suitable irrigation system can be used e.g. rubber hose, watering can, sprinkler or drippers. Ideally, irrigation should be done in the early morning, night or evening, to reduce evaporation. If water is scarce, mulching or a very superficial weeding will also decrease evaporation.

## Weeding

<p>Manual weeding with a pick removes weeds and loosens the soil for good aeration. 
<span class="parabold">Weeding must be done regularly to avoid competition for nutrients, especially for nitrogen.</span>If not weeded properly, the trees produce fewer leaves and  the leaves at the base of the plant begin to yellow. Weeding must be more frequent when the plantation is young and the trees are small, allowing light to reach the soil. It is advisable to weed an adult plantation at least 4 times a year, with a higher frequency during rain seasons.</p>

<p><span class="parabold">A good option is to leave the weeds on the soil as a mulch to reduce evaporation and enrich the soil.</span> Burying them is not necessary as tropical soils have a very low capacity to 
 retain minerals over time. It is better to let the weeds progressively enrich the soil as they decompose. Burying plant residues must be especially avoided on sloping terrain, to limit 
soil erosion. Weeding must be done early enough so that no seeds develop on the weeds. 
If fruits and seeds are present, weeds must be removed from the field.</p>

## Mulching

Mulching consists in covering the soil with crop or weed residue to reduce the loss of soil moisture and to minimize irrigation needs during the dry months. This also reduces weed growth.

## Fertilizing

Moringa can produce large quantities of leaves, but only if it receives enough organic supplements. Its leaves are rich in proteins and minerals, which means that the soil needs 
to provide enough nitrogen and minerals to the plants. Instead of chemical fertilizer, farmyard manure (animal dung mixed with plant residue) or compost (plant residue left to decompose on a heap) can provide the necessary nutrients as well as improve the soil structure. The best fertilization is ensured by mixing fast decomposing residue (animal 
dung, green and soft plant residue) with slow decomposing residue (straw, dry plant residue and thin branches).

<p><span class="parabold">Fertilization must be done during land preparation, before seeding.</span> After it is important to apply manure or compost at least once a year, for instance before the rainy season, when the trees are about to start an intense growth period (pruning can also be done at this time). If there are two rainy seasons, two applications are advised.</p>

## Pruning

After the initial pruning to shape the trees, maintenance pruning is required. This can be done at each harvest, if the leaves are removed by cutting all the stems above a certain height (see harvest). If leaves are harvested by plucking, or if the trees are left unharvested during the dry season, the bushy shape can be lost and a good pruning must be done at the onset of the rainy season. In Niger Africa, the trees are cut down to 20 cm above the ground once or twice a year. If the main stem is too thick, terminal branches can be cut down as in the initial pruning. In any case, it is important to cut just above a node to reduce rotting 
of terminal parts. In seed-producing farms, pruning helps induce more fruits, as well as larger fruits. Break the terminal bud when the plant is about one meter high to 
stimulate branching.


<Title anchorId="pests-and-diseases" icon={pestsIcon} heading="Pest and Disease Control" />

## Insects

The most common pests are grasshoppers, crickets and caterpillars. These insects bite and chew parts of the plant, causing the destruction of leaves, buds, flowers, shoots, fruits or seeds as well as the interruption of sap flow. These outbreaks are frequent in dry zones where moringa leaves strongly attract insects. It seems that these outbreaks occur at the beginning of the dry season when insects cannot find other tender, green material to feed on. The best solution, in this case, is to cut back the trees, leaving no green part apparent. The following growth is very vigorous if conditions permit (sufficient water supply). Concerning the Lepidoptera caterpillar, it is imperative to detect the outbreak at the beginning, at the shoot centre, in order to act before it is too late. Spraying must be aimed at the centre and the extremity of the shoots to reach the young caterpillars.

In organic farming, Bacillus thuringiensis (sold under the brand name Batik) is an insecticide composed of bacteria specific to Lepidoptera larvae. It must be ingested to be activated, with no impact on humans, wildlife or pollinators. The waiting period before harvesting is only three days. This insecticide is a good alternative to chemical products, is authorized in organic farming and has the advantage of a being a guaranteed preparation. Other brands exist like Delfin or Scutello. These products should be stored, if possible, in a cool place, at least protected from strong heat. According to the producer Certis, Delfin can be stored for three years at a temperature of 30°C. Neem extract can also be used against 
insects, if it is sprayed in time.

    <img src={caterpillarDamage} alt="caterpillar damage" />
</figure>

Termite attacks also cause damage to moringa plantations. Some organic solutions exist for termite control:   
>* Applying neem seed cakes to the soil.   
>* Applying castor oil plant leaves, mahogany chips, Tephrosia leaves or Persian lilac leaves      around the base of the trunk.   
>* Heaping ashes at the base of the trunk.   
>* Building termite traps using bowls filled with wet straw, soil and other vegetable waste      (wood chips, mango pits). The bowls are filled in the morning, turned up side down against      the soil, the edges slightly buried and covered with a handful of dry leaves to maintain      coolness. These traps should be checked every 24 to 48 hours.If synthetic insecticides have to be used, choose the least toxic, like pyrethroids (Decis, Karate, Klartan). They remain active for 20 days or more, even in hot or windy conditions. Pyrethroids kill Lepidoptera eggs. Allow a 7-day minimum waiting period before harvesting, 14 days if the leaves are to be eaten raw. Avoid reapplying more than 2 or 3 times per season as this could favour resistance development to the pesticide and aphid attacks.

These diseases are by far the most serious in moringa farming. Brown spots can appear on the leaves and then spread to cover them entirely, turning the leaves yellow and killing them. This is caused by the fungi Cercospora spp and Septoria lycopersici. Alternaria is also frequent: angular, dark-brown spots with concentric circles appear on the leaves. Black or brown marks appear on the branches as well. The fungus is known as Alternaria solani. 
The onset of the disease is hard to detect. Once the spots have appeared it is often too late to treat and defoliation is inevitable. It is therefore important to remember the periods when the symptoms appeared to be able to act earlier the following season. The effective, inexpensive products to use in both cases are made from either Mancozeb or Maneb.

The area around the trees, in organic farming, should be kept clear of weeds which are often hosts to diseases. The leaves and young shoots should be checked regularly for symptoms of fungal attacks. An early detection will save a lot of young plants from destruction. 
Neem leaf or seed extract can be sprayed on the plants to control pest and fungal attacks. This treatment is not as effective as using chemical products. The neem extract should be used as early as possible and sprayed repeatedly. Neem products can be produced locally and are not toxic for humans. The leaf extract is not as effective as the seed extract, but it can be used as well.
