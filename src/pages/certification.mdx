# Benefits of an Organic Certificate

**Safety and Transparency** - With the growing demand for moringa products, there has been an increase of counterfeit products and products of low quality that put consumers of moringa at risk. With an organic certificate, your product will have official proof of following 
best cultivation and processing practices. 

**Sustainability** - The practices covered in the Grow Organic Moringa  page are non-toxic to 
least toxic to the environment while maximizing crop yields per land mass.

**Scalability** – With a COMS certificate, your products can qualify to be sold to a larger international market, and allow your business to expand.

You inform us of any corrective measures. When in compliance, we issue an organic certificate and send you the COMS seal file to add to your product label.
